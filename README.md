## Summary
The Galaxy House, a decompression/resting structure was designed and created by Lucia Wong

This project was funded by a grant from Burning Man Toronto Regional T-ComP group and created during her internship at échoFab! 

Inspired by her Burning Man 2013 trip and the sculpture Heartfulness by Katy Boynton, Galaxy House too is about finding safe space. It's made in the same spirit as geodesic domes---temporary homes quickly installable anywhere. 

Viewers walk into the normal looking house to find a whole galaxy shining within. There are pillows on the floor to rest and a skylight to look up at.

## Construction ##
**Foundation**
The basis of a stilt house is that it is an unusual looking structure because it has a big top and little tiny legs. Practically, this is difficult to achieve because I need a strong foundation. 

I came up with the solution to use cement blocks for feet. So I drilled holes through the cement blocks and attached them to the 4x4 which together became my legs. The two parts were held together by 6" rods. 

**Walls**
My walls were made of metal that was rescued from giant ventilation vents from our old Communautique office. Ventilation proved to be really handy to use because they are all the same size and there's already big natural FOLDS in it, which saved me from having to figuring out a method to fold metal which is difficult and requires many tools! 

I didn't have enough pieces of metal, so I found big pieces of plywood to make the surface area bigger. And drilled holes through all the metal and plywood to attach them all together. I learned about the magic of self-drilling screws, which is fantastic for holding deep into wood without bolts. At the very end, I cut a little door into the plywood with a jigsaw.

**Roof**
The roof was the most difficult part of all the process because I wanted to install a gigantic panel of glass as a skylight. It was difficult to trust that all my calculations for the body and the legs were correct, in order to support this fragile roof that could be very dangerous if it were to fall on people inside! Luckily, the diagonal roof tiles held into place with brackets, and they were strong enough to hold the big piece of glass.

**Blacklight interior -- PAINTING PROCESS!**
First I painted the inside with black primer, spray painted several coats. And then covered the black with a special colorshifting holographic purple spray paint that I sourced from the US. And finally, for the blacklight effects and painting the details of the galaxy, I mixed glow in the dark aqua and green powder with acrylic extender base and flicked it on with a paintbrush. The whole room and paint effect was then activated by a blacklight flourescent tube that I installed over the door. 

Et voila! Finished!
